I am a tenure-track assistant professor in the School of Information Science and Technology at ShanghaiTech University.

I received the PhD degree from the Queen Mary University of London (QMUL) in 2018, supervised by Prof. Shaogang Gong. After that, I was a Postdoc Researcher at the University of Sydney (USYD), working with Prof. Dacheng Tao. In Nov 2020, I joined ShanghaiTech as a tenure-track assistant professor. My research interests include computer vision, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. Particularly, my current research focuses on human centered visual perception, inference and cognition.
