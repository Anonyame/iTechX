# Xiaopei Liu

I am doing research on fundamental problems of high-performance fluid flow simulations for complex phenomena by mesoscopic kinetic method, with one-way and two-way coupling to both dynamic rigid and deformable solids, as well as their large-scale distributed parallel computing, visualization and rendering, with applications to computer graphics, virtual reality, medical diagnosis, computational design & fabrication, geometric optimization, scientific visualization, as well as virtual robot training. I am also interested in machine learning techniques applied to all of the above areas and conducting related research. In addition, I am doing research on simulation-based small UAV design and autonomous navigation.
