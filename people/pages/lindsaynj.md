## Research Interest

In my research I study special classes of symplectic manifolds with a Hamiltonian group of symmetries. 
I am interested in the symplectic analogue of Fano varieties, called symplectic Fano manifolds, and to what extent these symplectic manifolds satisfy the boundedness of their algebraic counter-parts. 
In a joint work with Dmitri Panov we were able to show that 6-dimensional symplectic Fano manifolds with a Hamiltonian circle action are simply connected.
One of the main tools was to apply results of 4-dimensional symplectic geometry, such as Seiberg-Witten theory, via symplectic reduction. 
Currently, I am working to investigate other geometric and topological properties of symplectic Fano manifolds with a Hamiltonian circle action.
