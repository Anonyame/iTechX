## Biography

Boris Houska is an associate professor at the School of Information Science and Technology at ShanghaiTech University. His research interests include numerical optimization and optimal control, robust and global optimization, as well as fast model predictive control algorithms.

Boris Houska received a diploma in mathematics and physics from the University of Heidelberg in 2007, and a Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering from KU Leuven in 2011. From 2012 to 2013 he was a postdoctoral researcher at the Centre for Process Systems Engineering at Imperial College London. Subsequently, from 2013-14, he has worked as a research faculty member at Shanghai Jiao Tong University. Moreover, he has held visiting professor positions at the Freiburg Institute for Advanced Studies as well as at the Institute for Microsystems Engineering at the University of Freiburg (both in 2014) and various shorter academic visiting appointments, e.g., at UC Berkeley during Winter 2017 and Imperial College London during Summer 2018.

Boris Houska has been recipient of awards including ICCOPT Best Paper Prize for a Young Researcher in Continuous Optimization (Finalist, Top 3), a Marie-Curie Fellowship for the project Next Generation Algorithms for Robust and Global Optimization of Dynamic Systems, as well as an ShanghaiTech Excellent Professor Award from ShanghaiTech University. His paper on “ACADO Toolkit — An open source framework for automatic control and dynamic optimization” has been listed as highly cited paper by Web of Science.
