## Biography
Kewei Tu received BS and MS degrees in Computer Science and Technology from Shanghai Jiaotong University, China in 2002 and 2005 respectively and received a PhD degree in Computer Science from Iowa State University, USA in 2012. During 2012-2014, he worked as a postdoctoral researcher at Departments of Statistics and Computer Science of the University of California, Los Angeles, USA. Since 2014, he has been an assistant professor and then an associate professor with the School of Information Science and Technology at ShanghaiTech University, Shanghai, China. He has around 80 publications in major conferences and journals including ACL, EMNLP, NAACL, AAAI, IJCAI, NeurIPS and ICCV. He served as a PC member at many NLP and AI conferences, as an area chair at several conferences such as EMNLP and AAAI, and as an action editor of ACL Rolling Review.

## Research Interests
My research interest is in natural language processing, machine learning, knowledge representation, computer vision, and artificial intelligence in general. 

My current research focuses on combining symbolic, probabilistic and neural approaches to linguistic structures, including 

(1) their representation, inference, and automatic learning; 
(2) their direct application in natural language processing and extended application in other AI areas such as probabilistic knowledge representation and computer vision.
