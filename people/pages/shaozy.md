 I am a tenured associate professor in the School of Information Science and Technology@ ShanghaiTech University. I direct the Intelligence, Information and Decision Lab @ SIST!


I received my Ph.D. from the information engineering department @ The Chinese University of Hong Kong in December 2010. My advisor was Prof. Shuo-Yen Robert Li (Bob li). I was then a postdoctoral researcher, first worked with Prof. Minghua Chen until November 2012, then worked with Prof. Bob Li and Prof. Raymond Yeung until December 2013. Prior to my Ph.D., I received my B.S. and M.E from Peking University, Beijing, China, both in EE.


Prof. Jean Walrand@UC Berkeley served as a member of my Ph.D. Thesis Committee.


In 2012, I was a visiting research fellow at the EE department @ Princeton University.


In 2017, I was a visiting professor at the RISELab (previously AMPLab) of EECS department @ University of California at Berkeley, working with Prof. Ion Stoica and Prof. Michael Jordan.


I was also a visiting scientist at the Simons Institute for the Theory of Computing at Berkeley.
