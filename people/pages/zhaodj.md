## Research Interests

Most of Zhao’s research is on algorithmic game theory and multi-agent systems, especially mechanism design and its applications on social networks. He pioneered and promoted a new trend of mechanism design on social networks, namely how to incentivize the existing participants of a game to invite new participants via their social connections. For this research challenge, Zhao’s group have made several seminal contributions in auctions, coalitional games and matching with over 20 high-quality papers. He has also contributed a blue sky paper at AAMAS 2021 to set up the related research agenda and offered four tutorials at AAAI 2022, AAMAS 2019 and IJCAI 2017/2018.
