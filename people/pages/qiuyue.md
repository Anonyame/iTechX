I am currently an assistant professor at School of Information Science and Technology of ShanghaiTech University.

Before joining ShanghaiTech, I was an assistant researcher in the Computational Methods in Systems and Control Theory group, headed by Prof. dr. Peter Benner at Max Planck Institute for Dynamics of Complex Technical Systems, Magdeburg, Germany.

I did my PhD in applied mathematics in the Numerical Analysis group at Delft University of Technology, Delft, the Netherlands. I conduct my PhD research under the supervision of Prof. dr. Martin van Gijzen and Prof. dr. Kees Vuik.
