# Project

## Overview

Your have two options in this project.

#1. Programming assignments (this is the default option)
You are asked to write code to solve 2-3 problems. This option must be done individually (i.e., no grouping).

#2. Define your own project
Use what you have learned in this course to solve a problem of your choice. You may form a group of at most 4 people.
Expected workload: (option #1 workload) * (group size)
Evaluation criteria: relevance to this course, substance, soundness, novelty, and quality of the report and presentation.


## Programming assignments

Please view [link](https://pad.degrowth.net/s/SJ8EEFjLc). The ZIP file is in the same folder in iTechX.

## Define your own project

### Topic

Use what you have learned in this course to solve a problem of your choice.

### Group
There should be 1-4 people in each group. To find a group to join or recruit more members for your group, you may use the Piazza “search for teammates” function.

Please note that if you form a large group, you are expected to do more work. The ideal workload of your project would be: (project #1 workload) * (group size), so for example, if there are 3 people in your group, then ideally the workload should be three times of the project option #1 workload.

### Schedule
Presentation on June 8, Wed (in class)
Report by 11:59pm, June 10, Fri

### Grading
Your project will be judged by its relevance to this course, substance, soundness, novelty, and quality of the report and presentation.

### External Code Usage
While we do not prohibit usage of external code and tools in your project, please note that:

1) the core component and algorithms of your project should be implemented by yourself, and

2) in your final presentation and report you must explicitly list all the external resources that you use and explain how/why you use them.

After the final presentation, you will be asked to submit your source code along with your final project report, so we could manually check whether you follow the above policy.

### LDC Resources
You can access several NLP datasets via LDC. Please register at https://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/login and remember to select ShanghaiTech as your Organization. After we approve your registration, you can access the datasets in the "My Account" page -> "Corpora Invoiced". Please note that these datasets are licensed to our university and hance you are prohibited to disseminate them outside of our university.
